Weâ€™re ready to begin work on the Kirkwood Medical Practice website redesign.

âœ… New Look & Feel
Kirkwood needs a complete visual refresh â€” something clean, modern, and sleek. The new design should look professional and be fully responsive, ensuring it displays perfectly on both mobile and desktop devices.

ðŸŽ¯ Logo
Please make sure the logo is transparent and integrates smoothly with the new design.

ðŸ“Œ Design Inspiration
Take a look at RAK Hospitalâ€™s (https://rakhospital.com) website â€” this is a great example of the kind of style and professionalism weâ€™re aiming for with Kirkwood.

ðŸŽ¥ Project Instructions
Weâ€™ve prepared a folder with key project materials, including a video walkthrough explaining the website expectations.
Please watch the video carefully before proceeding:
